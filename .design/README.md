## Our design process

1. We tend to mark issues with a `design:required` label for everything where we love design input
2. Feel free to create issues on ANYTHING that you feel is relevant (can't be too crazy) with a `design:input` label
3. We groom through the issues and work asynchronously on them â€“ providing relevant materials for discussion right in the issues.
4. Depending on the issue we implement it on a branch (which create a preview environment) and mark it as `design:review` 
5. Once reviewed we will merge and deploy it to production
