## Our design process

1. We tend to mark issues with a `design:required` label for everything where we love design input
2. Feel free to create issues on ANYTHING that you feel is relevant (can't be too crazy) with a `design:input` label
3. We groom through the issues and work asynchronously on them â€“ providing relevant materials for discussion right in the issues.
4. Depending on the issue we implement it on a branch (which create a preview environment) and mark it as `design:review` 
5. Once reviewed we will merge and deploy it to production
   
## Architecture + Flow diagrams

### Flow diagrams

**`/api/shield/<org>/<prpject>` endpoint**
https://www.figma.com/file/0TyptXIxXyxiNmzAqZjNkc/architecture?node-id=3%3A197

**ClopudFlare worker for scraping projects**
We're using this worker to transition projects from "initially requested via Badge" to "is in our DB"
